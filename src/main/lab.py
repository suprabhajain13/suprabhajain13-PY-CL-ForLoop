    Let's try using a for loop to calculate the factorial of a number.

    The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
    For example:
        5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

    We'll use a for loop to multiply each number from 1 to n together to calculate the factorial.

    @param n: The number for which to calculate the factorial.
    @return: The factorial of the given number.
