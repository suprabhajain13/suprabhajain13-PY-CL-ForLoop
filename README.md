# PY-CL-ForLoop

## Overview
This project demonstrates the calculation of the factorial of a non-negative integer using a Python function. The `factorial` function in `lab.py` implements the factorial calculation using a for loop.

## Files

### lab.py
The `lab.py` file contains the implementation of the `factorial` function. This function calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using a for loop. It ensures that a `ValueError` is raised for negative input values.

### app.py
The `app.py` file serves as the entry point for the project. It allows users to input a non-negative integer and calculates its factorial using the `factorial` function from `lab.py`.

### lab_test.py
The `lab_test.py` file contains unit tests for the `factorial` function in `lab.py`. It verifies that the function correctly calculates the factorial of non-negative integers and raises a `ValueError` for negative input values.

## Getting Started
1. Open the `src/main/app.py` file.
2. Run the `app.py` file to execute the factorial calculation program.
3. Input a non-negative integer when prompted.
4. The program will calculate and display the factorial of the input integer.
5. Ensure to handle negative input values properly to avoid `ValueError` exceptions.

## Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience with implementing a for loop in Python to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer. By running the test cases and exploring the code, users can enhance their understanding of for loops and error handling in Python programming.

Happy Coding!
